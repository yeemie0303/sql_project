/* 
Customer Report
Purpose:
- This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors
Highlights:
1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
- total orders
- total sales
- total quantity purchased
- total products
- lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
- recency (months since last order)
- average order value
- average monthly spend */
